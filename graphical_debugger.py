# Ideas:
# 1. After each "new" statement, store the pointer to the assigned variable as well as the content of the variable -- (type, p_var, value)
# 2. After each assignment or declaration, keep track of the new or modified variables
# 3. After user selects a variable as the root object, display all adjacent objects associated to its pointer member variables.
